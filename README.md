## Overview

This workshop helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your entire R workflow (e.g., wrangling, modeling, and visualization). The end result is cleaner, faster, more readable and extendable code. I highly recommend you to take this workshop (1) if you still write copy-and-paste code, (2) exclusively rely on for loops for automation, and (3) want to know about the joy and power of R functional programming.

## Learning objectives

1. How to use `purrr` to automate workflow in a cleaner, faster, and more extendable way [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/01_why_map.html)]

2. How to use `map2()` and `pmap()` to avoid writing nested loops. [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/02_more_inputs.html)]

3. How to use `map()` and `glue()` to automate creating multiple plots [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/03_map_glue.html)]

4. How to use `reduce()` to automate joining multiple dataframes [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/04_reduce_join.html)]

5. How to use `slowly()` and `future_` to make automation process either slower or faster [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/05_slower_faster.html)]

6. How to use `safely()` and `possibly()` to make error handling easier [[Notebook](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/1650e53a815d7c6e5449e035fd61a21b646b43d7/lecture_notes/06_make_error_handling_easier.html)]

## Prerequisites

- Some experience with writing functions in R

## Setup

Launch the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming/master?urlpath=rstudio). Please do so before attending the worskshop as it would take a while (especially, if you do it for the first time).

## About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services. 

(include definition of IOKN2K!)
